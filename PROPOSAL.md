# Project Proposal

## YuenTing

This application takes a Chinese text file and parses it into words. The text or image is displayed in a new window, and allows the user to hover over each word to show the definition, pronunciation (can select Mandarin, Cantonese, or Korean), and part of speech. The text will be on one panel of the window, while the information of the hovered-over word will be on another panel side-by-side. 

Some difficulties would be getting the defintion of the word in that context correct and recognizing which characters make up a word as there are no spaces in Chinese.

This project will require the cppjieba library.
